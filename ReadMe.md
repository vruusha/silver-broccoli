To run this project you would need node and npm
I have used used npm v5.6.0 & node v8.11.4

1.please download the these versions from here 
https://www.npmjs.com/get-npm
https://nodejs.org/en/

2.open a command window in the root folder and run the following command
'npm run start'
This opens a dev server at https://localhost:5000/

3.if this fails delete the node-modules folder and  do a 'npm install' in the root folder
i.e inside stat-street
i.e open cmd go to the root folder and do 'npm install'
this should download the required install(not needed as I have included the node-modules)

4.Try the step 2 again.
