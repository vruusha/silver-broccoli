This project demonstrates the usage of ReactJs and mobx
For deploymnet I am suing webpack 4
You would need nodejs and npm to run this project

I am using node v8.11 and npm v5

Follow this link to install node and npm

https://www.npmjs.com/get-npm

After the initial set up:
1. Go to the proejct root folder
2.run 'npm install'
3.run 'npm run start'

This would start a dev server at port 5000

Please visit the URL http://localhost:5000/ to see the proejct running
